## 🔒 Copy Encrypted File to `ubuntu_latest` Container

The Nautilus DevOps team has confidential data on **App Server 1**. A container named `ubuntu_latest` is running on this server. We need to securely copy an encrypted file without modifying it.

Follow the steps below to copy the file:

### 📂 Step 1: Copy the Encrypted File

Use the `docker cp` command to copy the encrypted file `/tmp/nautilus.txt.gpg` from the host machine to the `/home/` directory inside the `ubuntu_latest` container:

```bash
sudo docker cp /tmp/nautilus.txt.gpg ubuntu_latest:/home/
```

### 🔍 Step 2: Verify the File is Copied

After copying the file, verify that it was successfully transferred and is located in the `/home/` directory inside the container by executing the following command:

```bash
sudo docker exec ubuntu_latest ls -ltr /home/
```

This will list the contents of the `/home/` directory to confirm the presence of `nautilus.txt.gpg`.

✅ **Note:** Ensure the file is not modified during the process by verifying file integrity before and after the operation.
