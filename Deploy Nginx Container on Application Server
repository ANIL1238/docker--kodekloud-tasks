## 🚀 Nginx Container Deployment on Application Server 1

The Nautilus DevOps team is conducting deployment tests, and we are required to deploy an `nginx` container on Application Server 1. Follow these steps to complete the task:

### 📝 Step 1: Check Application Server 1 Login Details

- Username: `tony`
- IP Address: `172.16.238.10`
- Password: `Ir0nM@n`

### 🔐 Step 2: SSH into Application Server 1

Open your terminal and connect to Application Server 1 by running the following command:

```bash
ssh tony@172.16.238.10
```

When prompted, enter the password:

```bash
Ir0nM@n
```

### 🛠️ Step 3: Deploy the Nginx Container

Once logged in, run the following command to deploy an `nginx` container with the `alpine` tag. Make sure to run it with `sudo` for appropriate permissions:

```bash
sudo docker run -d --name nginx_1 nginx:alpine
```

### ⚙️ Step 4: Verify the Container is Running

To ensure the container is in a running state, check the status with this command:

```bash
sudo docker ps
```

You should see the `nginx_1` container listed and running.

✅ **Note:** Always use `sudo` when running Docker commands to avoid permission issues.
