## 🗑️ Deleting `kke-container` from Application Server 1

One of the developers created a test container named `kke-container` on **App Server 1**. Since it was only for testing, it now needs to be removed. Follow the steps below to delete it:

### 🔍 Step 1: Check for Running Containers

First, verify that the `kke-container` is running by listing all containers:

```bash
sudo docker ps
```

Locate the `CONTAINER ID` of `kke-container`.

### ⏸️ Step 2: Stop the Container

Now, stop the container using the `CONTAINER ID` you found in the previous step:

```bash
sudo docker stop <CONTAINER_ID>
```

### 🗑️ Step 3: Remove the Container

Once the container is stopped, remove it:

```bash
sudo docker rm <CONTAINER_ID>
```

### ✅ Final Step: Verify Removal

To ensure the container has been deleted, you can run the following:

```bash
sudo docker ps -a
```

The `kke-container` should no longer appear in the list of containers.
